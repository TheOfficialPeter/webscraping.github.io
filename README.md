## Installing Python + Libraries

Installing python is really simple. Just visit [the official python web page](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and download the latest version and open the installer. During installation please make sure you have checked the box that **adds python to the PATH**. If you don't see the checkbox, add it manually. [Here](https://medium.com/@omoshalewa/why-you-should-add-python-to-path-and-how-58693c17c443) is an example. If this link is broken just google 'How to add python to PATH'.<br/>

After installing python we need to install the libraries needed to make web scraping possible. Luckily the first library is pre-installed. So we can start right away. We will cover the installation of libraries at **4. Introduction to Beautiful Soup**.
