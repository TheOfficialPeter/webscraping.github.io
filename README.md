## Installing Python + Libraries

Installing python is really simple. Just visit [the official python web page](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and download the latest version and open the installer. During installation please make sure you have checked the box that **adds python to the PATH**. If you don't see the checkbox, add it manually. [Here](https://medium.com/@omoshalewa/why-you-should-add-python-to-path-and-how-58693c17c443) is an example. If this link is broken just google 'How to add python to PATH'.<br/>

After installing python we need to install the libraries needed to make web scraping possible. Luckily the first library is pre-installed. So we can start right away. We will cover the installation of libraries at **4. Introduction to Beautiful Soup**.

### Installing VsCode and configuring Python

The next step for you it to grab your text editor so we can start coding some cool stuff. Personally I prefer using [Vim](https://www.vim.org) or [Vscode](https://code.visualstudio.com). I would recommend you to use VsCode since it is more beginner-friendly. After installing [Vscode](https://code.visualstudio.com) from the website, open it up and you should be greeted with a fancy looking UI. Now we are going to connect Python with Vscode otherwise we our text editor (Vscode) is useless. I will be explaining how to install the extension, but if you find it difficult to follow you can also visit the official tutorial [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/python). Upon being greeted with the main User Interface, navigate to the extensions tab. (Picture below of the extensions tab icon)

Search python in the textbox then install the first one. It might take some time to install.

After installing you'll be prompted to choose a python interpreter. Pick the one with the full file directory listed as below
